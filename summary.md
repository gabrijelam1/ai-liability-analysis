# Executive Summary: Liability for AI and Digital Technologies

This project examines the legal challenges around liability for harm caused by AI. Traditional laws struggle with AIâ€™s complexity, autonomy, and global nature. 

The analysis highlights:
- Current limitations in fault-based and strict liability systems.
- Proposed reforms, including updates to the Product Liability Directive, mandatory insurance, and shifting the burden of proof (presumption of causality).

The goal is balancing consumer protection with innovation, ensuring fair accountability without stifling technological growth.
