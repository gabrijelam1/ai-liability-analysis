# Project Summary â€“ AI Liability Analysis

This project presents a research-driven report focused on the legal and ethical challenges of assigning liability in the context of artificial intelligence. It explores how existing legal frameworks attempt to address responsibility in cases involving AI systems and automated decision-making, with reference to ongoing policy discussions in the European Union.

Framed by the evolving EU AI Act and the broader push for trustworthy AI, the report examines:

- Risk distribution and gaps in legal accountability  
- The limitations of human oversight in complex systems  
- Challenges in assigning blame to non-human actors  
- Ethical implications around transparency, control, and fairness

The project aims to highlight how legal and governance systems must adapt to AI complexity, and reflects the author's interest in responsible AI development, compliance, and digital policy.
